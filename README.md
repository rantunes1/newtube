A client for youtube's API implemented with angular.js
A replacement for youtube website

Tired of Google's non stopping changes to youtube, I decided to use their API and create my own youtube website. 

This is a sandbox project I use mainly to test new web based components or techniques.

features already implemented:
- user authentication with google oauth (working but not completed)
- user subscriptions page
    - shows information for individual videos (ratings, views, etc)
    - shows video description on a text bubble
    - video title links to video page
- video player page    
    - youtube player is integrated on page and working. this page needs to be extended.
- user channel's page 
    - routing only
- a working notifications' wall. still needs formatting.
